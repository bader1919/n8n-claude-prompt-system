# Main Branch Cleanup Checklist

This checklist provides step-by-step instructions to clean up the main branch of the repository. Follow each step carefully to ensure a clean and organized codebase.

## Step 1: Identify Files to Delete
- Review the repository files and identify any obsolete, unused, or temporary files.
- Common files to consider deleting:
  - Old configuration files no longer in use
  - Deprecated scripts or code files
  - Temporary files or logs
  - Backup files (e.g., files with extensions like `.bak`, `.old`)

## Step 2: Identify Files to Keep
- Confirm essential files that must remain in the main branch:
  - Source code files
  - Configuration files currently in use
  - Documentation files
  - Build and deployment scripts

## Step 3: Delete Unnecessary Files
- Delete the identified obsolete or unnecessary files from the main branch.
- Use git commands or your preferred Git client to remove files:
  ```bash
  git rm path/to/file
  git commit -m "Remove obsolete files"
  git push origin main
  ```

## Step 4: Verify File Integrity
- Ensure that all necessary files are intact and no critical files were accidentally deleted.
- Run tests and build processes to confirm the repository functions correctly.

## Step 5: Final Verification
- Review the repository status:
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
- Confirm no untracked or unwanted files remain.
- Check the commit history for clarity and accuracy.

## Step 6: Push Final Changes
- Push all cleanup changes to the remote main branch:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

## Step 7: Communicate Changes
- Inform your team about the cleanup and any important changes made.
- Update any relevant documentation or project management tools.
