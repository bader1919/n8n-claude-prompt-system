# Template Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Template Management System introduces an automated way to discover, manage, and monitor templates within the n8n Claude Prompt System repository. This system enhances workflow efficiency by integrating three new workflows and supporting advanced features such as multi-LLM support, versioning, and analytics.

## Workflows

### 1. Enhanced Template Discovery
- Automatically scans and identifies new and updated templates in the repository.
- Supports various template formats and metadata extraction.
- Triggers downstream processes for template validation and deployment.

### 2. Template Lifecycle Manager
- Manages the lifecycle of templates from creation, updates, to deprecation.
- Handles version control and rollback capabilities.
- Integrates with notification systems to alert stakeholders of changes.

### 3. Template System Dashboard
- Provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring template status, usage, and analytics.
- Displays version history, usage metrics, and error reports.
- Allows manual intervention and management of templates.

## Integration with Existing Components

- Seamlessly integrates with the existing n8n workflows and Claude prompt system.
- Utilizes existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Leverages current data storage and logging infrastructure.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bader1919/n8n-claude-prompt-system.git`
2. Import the three workflows (`enhanced-template-discovery`, `template-lifecycle-manager`, `template-system-dashboard`) into your n8n instance.
3. Configure necessary environment variables and credentials for API access and storage.
4. Deploy the workflows and verify connectivity.
5. Access the Template System Dashboard to monitor and manage templates.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-LLM Support
- Supports integration with multiple Large Language Models for template processing.
- Allows dynamic selection of LLMs based on template type or usage context.

### Versioning
- Maintains detailed version history for each template.
- Supports rollback to previous versions in case of issues.

### Analytics
- Collects and displays usage statistics and performance metrics.
- Provides insights into template effectiveness and error trends.
